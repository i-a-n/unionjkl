# blog.union.io: a Jekyll-powered site

just my personal blog. it's built using Jekyll and deployed to a standard linux server somewhere. more info on how I built it is [in this post](http://blog.union.io/code/2015/12/06/how-to-make-this-website/). I try to write something every few months or so.

it's deployed to https://blog.union.io
