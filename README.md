#union.io: a Jekyll-powered site

***

### Who?
My name is Ian. I write code and make fonts and spend all day working at [Typography.com](http://www.typography.com/). You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/union_io), on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/c/ianm), and in New York City.

### What?
This repository is a heavily customized version of the “Clean Blog” theme, a Jekyll template maintained [here on GitHub](https://github.com/IronSummitMedia/startbootstrap-clean-blog-jekyll).

I usually end up writing about typography, coding, or baseball.

### Where?
The site currently deploys to my personal blog, which you can find at https://blog.union.io/

### When?
I‘ve been maintaining this repository since December of 2015, but I‘ve included material of mine from as far back as 2010. I typically post about once a month or so.

### Why?
If you want to learn how, or why, I made this blog, [check out my post](http://blog.union.io/code/2015/12/06/how-to-make-this-website/). And yes, that post is currently sitting in this repository.
